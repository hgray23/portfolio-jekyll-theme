# Hugo's Theme

Hi everyone! My name's Hugo and if you're seeing this then that means I've done a good job. 
I'm currently a student living and have been living in France most of my life. I've studied business and management, and currently it's business analytics. 
I have a little experience in the tourism industy but I hope to be working in the sports world soon enough! I am currently undergoing a projet to be able to choose the right player for a football team using only data I've found online, so no eye-test to back up what I find. It's been challenging but a lot of fun to try to understand, and I hope it will be the first of many sports data projects I take on.
